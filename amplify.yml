# ⚠️ WARNING: AWS Amplify is NOT suitable for this application
# This is a Node.js server app that requires a running backend.
# AWS Amplify is designed for static sites or SSR frameworks (Next.js, Nuxt).
#
# Please see DEPLOYMENT.md for recommended deployment options:
# - Railway (recommended)
# - Render
# - AWS Elastic Beanstalk
# - Heroku
#
# This configuration will only deploy the static frontend files,
# but the backend API will NOT work without the server running.
